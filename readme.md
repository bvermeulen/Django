## Environment variables
Environment variables are give in the file `.env` and for obvious reasons not provided.   
Following settings must be given:
```
SECRET_KEY =
LOG_FILE =
DEBUG =
ALLOWED_HOSTS =
 
# postgresql database on localhost
DB_NAME =
DB_USER =
DB_PASSWORD =

# imgur client_id and key
IMGUR_CLIENT_ID =
IMGUR_SECRET_KEY =
 
# email mailgun
EMAIL_BACKEND = django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST = 
EMAIL_HOST_USER =
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD =
```
To work with `.env` add the following to Django `settings.py`:
```
from decouple import config, Csv
...
SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')
DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default=False, cast=bool)
ALLOWED_HOSTS = config('ALLOWED_HOSTS', cast=Csv())
etc
```
